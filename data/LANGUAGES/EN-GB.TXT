STR_VEHICLES_INFO = "Citizens of Mega-Primus use two types of vehicle. There are common road traveling vehicles that use a low cost anti-gravity system embedded in the road surface and airborne flyers which employ more sophisticated Elerium powered anti-gravity engines. The bold red military vehicles are available for X-COM to purchase."
STR_FACILITIES = "Base Facilities"
STR_FACILITIES_INFO = "X-COM bases are constructed from a variety of component units designed to perform different functions. The construction of a new base requires a bare minimum of living quarters and storage facilities. Beyond these requirements a base is designed to accommodate research, training and vehicle repair facilities. Bases will also need to be defended against aggression using well equipped Agents and security stations."
STR_VEHICLE_EQUIPMENT = "Vehicle Equipment"
STR_VEHICLE_EQUIPMENT_ INFO = "All military vehicles can be equipped with a variety of weapons, engines and special equipment. The engines and weapons are divided into road and airborne categories. Careful attention to improving vehicle equipment is an essential part of military strategy."

STR_BUILDINGS = “Buildings”
STR_BUILDINGS_INFO = “Each building in Mega-Primus is a vast labyrinth of corridors, atriums, rooms, halls and service ducts. If Aliens have infiltrated a building they will be found in just a small part of the complex, with plenty of places to escape from the combat zone. Buildings with lower populations or numerous service areas provide much better places for Aliens to hide and breed.”
ATR_ALIEN_DIMENSION = “The Alien Dimension”
ATR_ALIEN_DIMENSION_INFO = “All research into the origins of the Aliens and their home world is collected in this section.”
STR_PROBE = “Alien Probe”
STR_PROBE_INFO = “The structure of the vehicle suggests an organic construction process. The skin is composed of a strong and unusual compound that allows the craft to travel without harm through the Dimension Gates. This unmanned craft is equipped with an unusual type of beam weapon. Its limited capability suggests that it is purely designed to collect information and then return to the Alien Dimension.”
STR_SCOUT_SHIP = “Alien Scout Ship”
STR_SCOUT_SHIP_INFO = “This vessel appears to be a surveillance craft. Its structure is very strange and there is no evidence of any crew or cargo. The craft's internals appear to have been intentionally destroyed by the Aliens from a remote location. The craft is armed with small beam weapon. The craft does not appear to be a great threat to the city, but can only be a precursor to more dangerous incursions.”
STR_TRANSPORTER_SHIP = “Alien Transporter”
STR_TRANSPORTER_SHIP_INFO = “The primary mission of this craft is to deposit Alien life forms inside city buildings. This represents a serious challenge for our ground forces, but if they can be shot down before they unload their passengers, then the problem will be minimized. The craft is armed with the same beam weapon as the Scout Ships or Probes, but it is slower moving and an easier target to hit.”
STR_FAST_ATTACK_SHIP = “Alien Fast Attack Ship”
STR_FAST_ATTACK_SHIP_INFO = “This craft is well armored, highly maneuverable and armed with a powerful beam weapon. It is designed to protect other more vulnerable Alien ships. Avoid these craft if the threat to our vehicles is too great and concentrate on shooting down the Alien Transports.”

STR_BATTLESHIP = “Alien Battleship”
STR_BATTLESHIP-INFO = “This immense craft is heavily armored, well armed and has a large crew. It is equipped with a Heavy Disruptor Beam and Disruptor Missiles. If the Aliens can produce just a handful of these devastating leviathans, the future of our world looks bleak.”

STR_MOTHERSHIP_INFO = “The Mothership is an extremely large, well equipped vessel. It is armed with a Heavy Disruptor Beam, Disruptor Multi-Bombs and Stasis Field Bombs. It represents a very serious threat to the city because its purpose seems to be mass destruction rather than infiltration. If the Aliens become desperate they will deploy this craft to raze the city to the ground. They must be stopped at all costs.”
STR_POLICE_HOVERCAR = “Police Hovercar”
STR_POLICE_HOVERCAR_INFO = “Megapol's police Hovercars are the scourge of the slum dwelling criminal gangs. They are well armed and able to travel freely within and outside the city boundaries, scouring the ground or air for unlicensed criminal vehicles. They are no match for heavier military vehicles, but Megapol is able to manufacture many of these scout cars and can replace any losses. The vehicle's styling is required to conform to city aesthetic ordinances concerning pleasurable design of public vehicles.”
STR_AIRTAXI = “Airtaxi”
STR_AIRTAXI_INFO = “The wealthy citizen would not normally travel by people-tube or road, but instead hire the services of a fast and reliable Airtaxi.

STR_RESCUE_TRASNPORT = "Rescue Transport"
STR_RESCUE_TRASNPORT_INFO = "The airborne rescue vehicle serves as an ambulance and fire engine. It is specially equipped to deal with rescue situations involving car accidents and other disasters.

STR_HOVERBIKE = "Hoverbike"
STR_HOVERBIKE_INFO = "The unusual Hoverbike with 'side car' is used for military purposes or for the personal pleasure of wayward youth who enjoy speed and altitude. Its good power to weight ratio means that this is the most maneuverable air vehicle but it can only carry light armaments. The Hoverbike can be a valuable means of transport for the  Agent on investigative missions where speed of response is essential."
STR_VALKYRIE = "Valkyrie Interceptor"
STR_VALKYRIE_INFO = "The Valkyrie is the standard military vehicle manufactured by Marsec. Its sleek lines appear reminiscent of old rocket designs, but it is a fully capable anti-grav dependent craft with a variety of engine configurations.

STR_ANNIHILATOR = "Annihilator"
STR_ANNIHILATOR_INFO = "The ultimate expression of X-COM technology - a mean, fast and devastating craft which, if properly equipped, is more than a match for the biggest Alien attack ships. The Annihilator will help secure X-COM domination of the Alien Dimension."
STR_AUTOTAXI = "Autotaxi"
STR_AUTOTAXI_INFO = "The road going Autotaxi is a more luxurious and relaxed form of public transport than the bustling People Tubes. Although a driver is not technically required regulations specify that a 'driver' is needed to fulfill the required inter-personal contact, which is necessary in a society dominated by automation."
STR_AUTOTRANS = "Autotrans"
STR_AUTOTRANS_INFO = "A computer controlled, fully automated goods vehicle. The road going Autotrans is a more economical version of the Airtrans, but the AI is still so advanced that they can anticipate demand for their services with uncanny accuracy and rarely need to be ordered in advance."
STR_POLICE_CAR = "Police Car"

Any injuries would otherwise have to be dealt with by the city hospitals, where the safety of Agents cannot be guaranteed. Injured Agents are automatically healed when they reside at a base with a Medical Bay, but if the capacity of the Medical Bays are exceeded then healing will not take place at 100% efficiency."
STR_TRAINING_AREA = "Training Area"
STR_TRAINING_AREA_INFO = "Training in physical skills is essential for X-COM Agents. Without a fully equipped training area, Agents residing at the base would waste a lot of time when they could be improving their weapons skills, reactions and stamina. Agents assigned to combat training will automatically use any training facilities at a base, but if the capacity of Training Areas is exceeded then training will not take place at 100% efficiency."
STR_PSI_GYM = "Psi-Gym"
STR_PSI_GYM_INFO = "Agents which are naturally talented in Psionic skills need to train hard to maintain and improve their power, attack and defense. The Psi-Gym is equipped with the latest Psionic technology and Psionic training is not possible without such a facility.
